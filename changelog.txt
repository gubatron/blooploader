    - Unlisted  - Added the ability to download a file that the user owns (audio files copied from other users cannot be downloaded)

    REFACTORS:

      Moved all upload logic from RemoteSession into UploadManager, UploadTransaction and QHttpUploadProxy. RemoteSession is meant solely
      for Bloop account operations, not uploads, it only assists in preparing the initial upload token for a transaction.
    - Easier worker thread management, some classes now extend 'utils.Employer'
    - Cleaned over 80 warnings, 30 errors that were probably causing or would cause unreported bugs. Thanks to PyLint and PyDev
